## Hi there 👋 I am Soumya, a Software Engineer 👩‍💻 based in London.

### Github is my space to translate all those random lightbulb moments 💡 into code (hence private to save the embarassment 😳)

- 🌟 My top skills are: Python 🐍, Java ☕ & GCP ☁️
- 🌱 I’d love to learn about: Natural Language Processing
- ⚡ Fun fact: I created Duolingo's Hindi course over a period of 3 years. I also translate TED Talks for fun!
